after https:// or http:// is typed, turn text blue?

 - case insensitive
 - "-" and "_" and "" (no marker) all get to the same url (saves multiple aliases)
 = /WEIGHTS /Weights /weights /wei-ghts /_weightS_
 - display: as typed (including upper case if desired!)


feature: if you use an alias for the name, recanonicalize:
also, insert http:// by default!
